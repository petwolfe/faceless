Project rebooted to contain gists since gist.github.com seems to be blocked from where most of the work is done.
Code here covers the following functionalities. Only Windows environment is listed here currently.

1. Creating graphs in Excel using time-series data.
2. Creating graphs in Excel using data from a CSV file.
3. Framework for carrying out repetitive jobs in Windows environments. Sort of like plug and play batch job executions.
4. Enhancing the above batching part to include some sort of UI operations (Like SikuliX).
